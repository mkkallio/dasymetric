#' Computes weights \code{HSweights} from \code{HS} and a river network
#'   
#' The function computes weights either based on catchment areas (polygons), 
#' or line segments which intersect a polygon with runoff information. Weights 
#' are assigned so that the sum of weights for area or line features within a 
#' polygon equal to 1.
#' 
#' The river network needs to be a "clean", connected network. This means that 
#' connected river segments share a node at the point of confluence, and all 
#' linestrings are cut at segment intersections.
#'
#' Weights should be one of the following: "equal", "length", "strahler", "area", 
#' or a numeric vector which specifies the weight for each river segment. 
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{equal} option assigns equal weights to all river segments within 
#'   a polygon.
#'   \item \code{length} option weights river segments within a polygon based on 
#'   the length of the segment.
#'   \item \code{strahler} option weights river segments based on the Strahler 
#'   number computed for the 
#'   supplied river network.
#'   \item A numeric vector with length equal to the number of features in
#'    \code{river}. Weights will be computed within a polygon: \eqn{x_i/sum(x)}
#'   \item \code{area} option weights the river segments based on segment-specific 
#'   catchment area falling inside a polygon. See more details below.
#' }
#' 
#' If line-based weights (equal, length, strahler, user specified vector) are 
#' used, the river network is split at grid cell boundaries before determining 
#' polygon-segment relationship.
#'
#' "area" weights can be used when catchment-based weighting is desired. If no 
#' further data is supplied, the function computes a Voronoi diagram from the 
#' river network (see \code{\link{river_voronoi}} for details). If the basins 
#' are known, they can be supplied which allows skipping the delineation step 
#' entirely.
#'
#'
#' @param HS  A 'HS' object, obtained with \code{\link{raster_to_HS}}.
#' @param river An 'sf' linestring feature representing a river network.
#' @param basins An 'sf' polygon object. If weights are set to "area", providing 
#'   basins skips the delineation process. ID column must have the name as 
#'   \code{riverID} See details. Optional. Defaults to \code{NULL}.
#' @param dasymetric Column name in \code{river} or in \code{basins} to be used 
#'   as the ancillary information in dasymetric mapping. If \code{NULL} 
#'   (default), no dasymetric mapping is performed. See details.
#' @param pycnophylactic Column in \code{HS} to be used as basis in 
#'   pycnophylactic interpolation. If \code{NULL}, or if \code{is.null(basins)},
#'   not performed. See details.
#' @param n Number of iterations when using pycnophylactic interpolation. 
#'   Default \code{25}.
#' @param intensive Whether the pycnophylactic variable is intensive (density,
#'   like runoff in mm), or not (in which case it is extensive, or counts like
#'   runoff in volume). 
#' @param weights Name of a column in \code{river} to be used directly as 
#'   weights. Defaults to \code{NULL}. See Details.
#' @param aoi An area of interest ('sf' polygon object) used to intersect 
#'   \code{river}. Ignored, if basins provided (in which case, aoi is the union
#'   of \code{basins}). Defaults to \code{NULL}.
#' @param riverID A character string which specifies the name of the column in 
#'   \code{river} containing unique river network identifiers. Defaults to 
#'   \code{"riverID"}.
#' @param verbose Whether or not print progress indicators.
#'   
#'
#' @return Returns a list object with class 'HSweights', containing the following 
#'   elements:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item \code{river}. The supplied river network with routing information. 
#'       See \code{\link{river_network}} for details.
#'     \item \code{weights}. River network lines or catchment polygon network 
#'       which was used as the basis of weighting. See 
#'       \code{\link{compute_area_weights}} or \code{\link{compute_river_weights}} 
#'       for details.
#'     \item \code{HS}. The input HS object containing runoff information.
