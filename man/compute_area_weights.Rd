\title{Compute weights for river catchment areas within the runoff area 
features.}
\usage{
compute_area_weights(
  source,
  target,
  pycno = NULL,
  dasy = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  n = 20,
  intensive = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{weights}{Name of a column in \code{river} to be used directly as 
weights. Defaults to \code{NULL}. See Details.}

\item{n}{Number of iterations when using pycnophylactic interpolation. 
Default \code{25}.}

\item{intensive}{Whether the pycnophylactic variable is intensive (density,
like runoff in mm), or not (in which case it is extensive, or counts like
runoff in volume).}
}
\value{
Returns an 'sf' polygon feature (a union of basins, and HS) 
  with added attributes (columns):
  \itemize{
    \item \emph{ID}. Unique ID of the feature.
    \item \emph{riverID}. ID of the river segment each sub-catchment is 
      associated to.
    \item \emph{sourceID}. ID of the runoff unit the sub-catchment 
      is contained in.
    \item \emph{weights}. Weights computed for each sub-catchment.
    \item \emph{target_area}. Area of the sub-catchment (basin) in 
      \eqn{m^2}.
    \item \emph{source_area}. Area of the runoff unit sub-catchment is 
      contained in.
}
}
\description{
Computes weights for each individual river segment specific catchments 
falling in the areal units of the runoff \emph{source}. Function first 
takes a union between \emph{basins} and \emph{source} (creating new 
catchment units which fall inside only one runoff unit), and calculating 
the area for each individual catchment unit. The weight is assigned by 
dividing the area of sub-catchment with the area of runoff unit.
